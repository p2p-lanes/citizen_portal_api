# NocoDB Webhooks Configuration

## Overview

NocoDB webhooks enable automatic notifications to the Citizen Portal API when specific events occur in the database. These webhooks are essential for triggering emails and other actions based on application status changes.

## Available Webhooks

The following webhooks should be configured in your NocoDB instance:

* **Application Accepted Standard**: Sends confirmation email when an application is approved with standard pricing
* **Application Rejected**: Sends notification when an application is rejected
* **Application Accepted Discounted**: Sends confirmation email when an application is approved with discounted pricing
* **Application Accepted Without Discount**: Sends confirmation email when an application is approved without any discount
* **Update Application Status**: Handles general status change notifications

All of these are triggered by the event type `On Record Update`.

## Webhook Configuration Steps

### 1. Access Webhooks in NocoDB

Navigate to the **Webhooks** tab in your NocoDB interface.
